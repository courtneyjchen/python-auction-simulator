# Python Auction Simulator

## Project Overview
In this project, I built an object-oriented ad auction simulator in Python and implemented a Multi-Armed Bandit strategy to optimize bidding returns. Using reinforcement learning principles, the bidding agent balances exploration (learning user click behavior) and exploitation (bidding for high-value impressions), all while competing against other strategic bidders.

The project uses object-oriented programming and applies an epsilon-greedy strategy with exponential decay to reduce exploration over time. The bidding algorithm is tested in a simulated environment with multiple competitors, replicating the dynamics of real-world ad auctions.

This project was developed as part of a competitive testing framework, where various bidding strategies were evaluated to determine the most effective approach. The strategy implemented here outperformed other bidders by leveraging a simple yet effective exploration-exploitation balance.
